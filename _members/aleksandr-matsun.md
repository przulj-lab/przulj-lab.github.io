Aleksandr Matsun is a Research Engineer in the [**Integrative Computational Network Biology Lab**](https://przulj-lab.github.io/) at [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/). He specializes in applying deep learning and artificial intelligence methods to drug discovery, multi-omics analysis, and biomedical image analysis.

Aleksandr's research focuses on computational drug discovery, including in-silico drug generation pipelines, molecular docking, target identification, and multi-omics-based modeling for aging-related gene and drug discovery. He has successfully discovered multiple SIRT1 allosteric activators with significantly improved binding affinity. His expertise spans computer vision applications in medical imaging, including chest X-ray analysis, surgical tool detection, and diabetic retinopathy classification. He has contributed to publications at major conferences including WACV, MICCAI, and has developed open-source tools for biomedical research.

Before joining the ICON Lab, Aleksandr worked as a Researcher at [Technology Innovation Institute](https://www.tii.ae/) (2024-2025) on medical imaging tasks, and completed internships at [Insilico Medicine](https://insilico.com/) (2023) focusing on disease hypothesis extraction from bioentity knowledge graphs, and at [Sberbank](https://www.sberbank.com/) (2020) on agricultural ML applications. He obtained his M.S.E. in Computer Vision from MBZUAI in 2024 and his M.S.E. in Applied Mathematics from [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT)](https://mipt.ru/english/) in 2021. Aleksandr has extensive experience in software development, having worked on robotics projects at MIPT's Starkits Lab and computer vision systems at CITaS.
