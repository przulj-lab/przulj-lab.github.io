Branislava Jankovic is a PhD student in the **Integrative Computational Network Biology Lab** at [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), where she is supervised by Professor Nataša Pržulj. Her research in the ICON Lab focuses on combating antibiotic resistance through computational approaches, including identifying novel protein targets and proposing new drugs or repurposing existing drugs to address this critical global health challenge.

Branislava's work combines AI-driven methods with computational biology to tackle antibiotic resistance, leveraging network-based approaches and multi-omics data integration for drug discovery and target identification. Her previous research spans disaster management using UAV-based aerial image classification, smart agriculture, and medical imaging. She has published at major conferences including [CVPR](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/), [ISCC](https://2025.ieee-iscc.org/), and [IWCMC](https://iwcmc.org/), and in the [IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=4609443). Her expertise includes computer vision, deep learning, IoT systems, optimization techniques, and resource-efficient AI for real-world applications.

Before beginning her PhD, Branislava completed her M.Sc. in Computer Vision at MBZUAI (2023-2025), and her B.Sc. in Radiophysics and Electronics at [State University of Nizhni Novgorod](https://eng.unn.ru/) (UNN), Russia (2018-2022), graduating with honors. She has extensive research experience from the Laboratory of Physical Fundamentals and Wireless Technologies at UNN (2017-2023), where she designed innovative IoT solutions and automated physical processes.
