Nataša Pržulj is a Professor of Computational Biology at [**MBZ University of Artificial Intelligence**](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/natasa-przulj/) and Principal Investigator of [**Integrative Computational Network Biology Lab**](https://przulj-lab.github.io/). She has been a Full Professor of Computer Science at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) since 2016.

She is a leader in biological network analysis and a pioneer in network biology geometry applied to personalized (precision) medicine. She introduced graphlets to extract biomedical knowledge from molecular networks, revolutionizing the field. Graphlets are now widely built upon and utilized to produce feature vectors capturing network topology, that are input into many AI algorithms for network data analytics in various domains.
Her research has been supported by over €27 million in competitive research funding. Notably, she received three prestigious, single PI, European Research Council (ERC) grants: ERC Consolidator (2018-2025), ERC Proof of Concept (2020-2023) and ERC Starting (2012-2017).

She was elected into many academies, including: Fellow of the [International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB)](https://www.iscb.org/), in 2024; Fellow of the [European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS)](https://ellis.eu/), in 2024; Fellow of the [British Computer Society (BCS) Academy of Computing](https://www.bcs.org/about-us/bcs-academy-of-computing/), in 2013; [The Serbian Royal Academy of Scientists and Artists (SKANU)](https://www.sanu.ac.rs/en/), in 2019; Academia Europaea, [The Academy of Europe](https://www.ae-info.org/), in 2017; Scientific Advisor of the [Mathematics Institute of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU)](https://www.mi.sanu.ac.rs/), in 2012; etc. In 2014, she received the [British Computer Society Roger Needham Award](https://www.bcs.org/events/awards-and-competitions/roger-needham-award/), sponsored by Microsoft Research, in recognition of the potential her research has to revolutionize health and pharmaceutics. She obtained a PhD in [Computer Science from the University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) in 2005.
