Tarmo Nurmi is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [**Integrative Computational Network Biology Lab**](https://przulj-lab.github.io//) at [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/). He is an expert in multilayer network analysis, network science, and computational neuroscience, specializing in developing novel methods for analyzing complex network structures.

Dr. Nurmi's research focuses on multilayer networks, including the development of graphlet-based analysis tools for characterizing local structures, algorithms for subnetwork enumeration, and frameworks for handling time-changing dynamic networks in human brain data. His work bridges theoretical network science with practical applications in neuroscience and complex systems. He has created and contributed to major software tools, including [pymnet](https://github.com/bolozna/Multilayer-networks-library), a Python library for multilayer network analysis.

Before joining MBZUAI, Dr. Nurmi completed his doctoral research at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), Finland (2019-2025), where he worked in the Complex Systems group under the supervision of Professor Mikko Kivelä. His dissertation, "Multilayer networks: phenomena, theory, and practice," received recognition for its contributions to network science methodology. He has published in high-impact journals including [Journal of Complex Networks](https://academic.oup.com/comnet) and [IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6488902). Dr. Nurmi is an accomplished researcher with international training, including studies at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), and was awarded a Bronze Medal at the International Biology Olympiad in 2013.
