Stevan Milinkovic is a Research Scientist in the [**Integrative Computational Network Biology Lab**](https://przulj-lab.github.io/) at [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) and Professor Emeritus at [Union University – School of Computing](https://www.raf.edu.rs/) in Belgrade, Serbia. He is an expert in artificial intelligence methods for uncovering molecular organization of life, embedded AI systems, and distributed artificial intelligence.

Dr. Milinkovic has made pioneering contributions across multiple domains, including early development of IoT-like sensor networks (2000-2001), decentralized time-stamping algorithms that preceded blockchain technology (2012-2013), and most recently, [Yottaanswers.com](https://yottaanswers.com/) (2022-present) – an alternative to large language models that is small, cost-effective, explainable, and incrementally expandable. His work spans smart energy systems, real-time embedded systems, and industrial AI applications, with technology transfer experience from research to industry.

Before joining MBZUAI, Dr. Milinkovic served as Dean of Union University's School of Computing (2003-2008, 2019-2022) and held research positions in Canada at Chrysalis-ITS and Quatrosense Environmental Limited. He has published extensively with over 29 journal articles and 92 conference papers. He obtained his Ph.D. in Engineering Sciences from the University of Belgrade in 1993. Dr. Milinkovic is co-founder and Chief Operating Officer of [Yottaanswers Inc.](https://yottaanswers.com/) and has served on multiple academic and industry boards, including the Conference of Universities of Serbia (CONUS) and the Serbian Chamber of Commerce.
